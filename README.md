# 🌤️ Weather App

A simple and clean **Weather App** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** that displays real-time weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

This project was created as part of my learning journey and demonstrates my ability to consume APIs and build responsive UIs using only core web technologies.
